Unit 3 Vocab
Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data. Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point - Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) - lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data.</p>

<p>Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms -</p>

<p>Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators - Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables</p>

<p>Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration - These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence</p>

<p>Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables - ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND.</p>

<p>Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings - Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them.</p>

<p>Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements - Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true.</p>

<p>Python For, While loops with Range, with List - various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable.</p>

<p>Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it</p>

<p>Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values - Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output.</p>

<p>Decidable problems: You can develop an algorithm for these problems, specifically yes or no</p>

<p>Undecidable problem: No algorithm can be used in order to provide a correct yes or no problems.</p>

<p>Problem: description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm Decision problem: A problem with a binary answer Algorithm: A series of ways to solve a problem. Process or a set of rules</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, and 4 step
1: Linear
2: Exponential
3: Square
4: Factorial Superpolynomial: Offers an incredibly small amount of data incredibly large amounts of time.
Simulation: Simulates a real-world experiment (abstraction of a complicated phenomena)</p>

<p>Removes unnecessary details
Level of abstraction depends on who/why we’re creating it
Ex: A flying simulator
Documentation: The what, how, or why of the code Libraries: Prewritten code or procedures that can be used to maximize efficiency API: Data stored in a database that can be accessed via code</p>

<p>Random: A library in python to assist in pseudo-randomness</p>

<p>Method/Function/Procedure - A set of code that can be run as a package, that takes in parameters and returns a return value</p>

<p>Example: add(1, 2), which adds two numbers
Catch all terms for a set of code
Parameter - Input values for procedures</p>

<p>Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose</p>

<p>Parameter: are input values of a procedure ^ There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements (void)</p>

<p>Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program</p>

<p>Binary Search: An algorithm to search methodically for an item in a sorted list</p>

<p>Algorithms: Steps in order repeated or run through to accomplish a task</p>

<p>Problem: description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm Decision problem: A problem with a binary answer Algorithm: A series of ways to solve a problem. Process or a set of rules</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, and 4 step
1: Linear
2: Exponential
3: Square
4: Factorial Superpolynomial: Offers an incredibly small amount of data incredibly large amounts of time.</p>

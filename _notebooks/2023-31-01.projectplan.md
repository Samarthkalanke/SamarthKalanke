# Overview
For our group CPT project, we are planning a road trip. We called our project roadtrip. My share for the project is to deploy it through AWS and help Khalid with the backend. 
## Purpose and Function
Purpose: allows the users to plan for a roadtrip and find their best car.

â€‹Function: There will be a frontend that allows a user to take a quiz to find their best car. We will also have this for resturants along the way and the best rounte.

## Data Abstraction
When the JSON data for all the saved the info is passed, people take a quiz to find what is best for them. 


## Testing
My two tests would be with a review of the favorited recipes in the JSON list:
1. Test to see if when clicked the cars are working. 
2. Test to see if the resturant test is working.

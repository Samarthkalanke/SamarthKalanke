The next few week focuses on some very detailed algorithms, but we hope to express these details visually with our Web and Blogging capabilities.  Data and binary are sometimes considered boring, but we produce data with analytics or learn to alter the internals of images,  the data and algorithms can become VERY interesting.\n",

# Notes

## Design

### Purpose
 The test that I made was on basic information about the NBA
 I wanted to make a test that had the variable score and it would keep on getting bigger or smaller based on wether your answer was right
 I wanted to have every question about the NBA but just the basics of it 
 I used the on event to activate the quiz and change between screens when a button was clicked
 At the end I wanted the test to tell the score that you got once the button was clicked

### Data Abstraction
I got the Data from google 
I put the questions and the answers in the design tab of code.org

### Managing Complexity
I made a score variable that kept track of score and goes down or up based on if they clicked the right answer.
If they clicked the right answer it took them to a right answer page and the same thing for if they clicked the wrong answer.
At the end I made it so that it will give the percentage of your correct anserwers when a button is clicked on

### Algorithim Implemantion
Step 1 Display home page  
Step 2 When `Click to start` is pressed then     
    Step 2.1 next quiz question shows with the MC answers  
    Step 2.2 When correct answer is selceted then  
        Step 2.2.1 Correct page is displayed   
        Step 2.2.2 the score variable increases by 1  
    Step 2.3 else  
         Step 2.3.1 incorrect page is shown  
    Step 2.4 go to step 2.1 and repeat for all 3 questions  
Step 3 Count of correct answers is shown

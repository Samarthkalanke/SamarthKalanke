# Notes

## Structure
        The test that I made was on basic information about the NBA
        I wanted to make a test that had the variable score and it would keep on getting bigger or smaller based on wether your answer was right
        I wanted to have every question about the NBA but just the basics of it 
        I used the on event to activate the quiz and change between screens when a button was clicked
        At the end I wanted the test to tell the score that you got once the button was clicked

# Method to Success

I choose to prepare for the AP exam using a more conventional approach rather than practicing MCQs. I made an effort to work on the MCQ a little, but it was ineffective. I had the impression that by attempting to solve those challenges, I was not gaining any additional insight as I worked on it. This is because I realized that my inability to conceptually grasp the large ideas was a personal shortcoming. I found that taking notes on the various units and concepts ultimately proved to be much more beneficial for me than practicing using practice MCQs.

Converting between binary formats was a significant skill I acquired. I was terrible at them, and I struggled to understand the methodology for a very long period. I took my time and tried to study it the traditional way because all the classes on it were confusing to me. I discovered that doing MOD(the number) was the key. You divide that amount by two again, and so on, until you reach MOD(1). You evaluate that and then write the numbers down, bottom to top.

I gained a lot of knowledge about connections and bits as well. The supplemental Khan Academy videos and lessons were a huge help to me because I needed some more assistance. It was beneficial for me to also understand about bit rate.

Another important topic was the conversion of analog data. As a musician, I find the unlimited resolution of analog data to be fascinating. The converting process was another something I found to be quite interesting.

In addition to everything else, I also learnt about a variety of mistakes. Prior to this, I had no idea what a roundoff mistake was, thus I became quite interested in floating point representation.

# Reflection

In general, I found that the test's application of these ideas was rather perplexing, and I spent a lot of time getting stuck on some of the tasks. After the AP exam, I discovered that I was able to respond to inquiries concerning binary and redundancy thanks to my conceptual self-learning. I had to teach myself everything from scratch, or, to put it another way, build up the foundation. I attempted to complete the MCQ, but I thought that it was of no benefit to me and that it would be a better use of my time to simply use Khan Academy for note-taking and self-teaching.

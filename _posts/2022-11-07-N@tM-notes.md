# Project at N@TM
-Our presentation went well I thought especially for the quality of our flask. 
-Our project was an app that had 3 buttons that took motivational quotes from 3 different APIs and randomly spat them out when pressed. There was also a chart that allowed people to say if they like some quotes or not. 
-We faced the problem of dating in real time, and there were many assorted distractions, we also faced a lot of errors with the code.

# Other projects
I liked seeing 3D animation stuff, because I was in the class last year and found it interesting. Mainly I liked the model of a person someone did.
I really liked ceramics, especially because they had a ceramic fruit from One Piece, and anime I really like
For CSP, I saw the lawnmowers, who created multiple games on fastpages.

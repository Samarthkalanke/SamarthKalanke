# Question 17
Answer A is incorrect because routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in beforehand.

# Question 8 
Answer D is incorect because it does not change the values of j and k. However, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged.

# Question 11
Answer C is incorrect because the inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with the all elements that follow it, not the one that proceds it.

# Question 32
Answer D is incorrect because the last assignment procedure assigns a copy of myList to yourList, rather than adding one list to the other.

# Question 36
Answer A is incorect because this would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 2 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19].

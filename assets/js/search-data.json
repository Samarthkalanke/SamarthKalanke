            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . &lt;font color=#FF0000&gt;Undecidable problems are problems that algorithms simply cannot solve. One of the first problems discovered is the halting problem. Most of these problems are paradoxical and theoretical situations where answers are most likely are subjective. However, some of these problems can have situations where some inputs have values. But not all values are going to have outputs.&lt;/p&gt; Decidable problems are problems that algorithms can return an output for all inputs. Mostly, these are algebraical problems that are simply solvable. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C.

Notes and Vocabulary (Extra Work) . Notes . Pseudo-random number generators are used to mock the imperfections that are always in the real world and save resources | When making a simulation you should consider: | Removing details by using pseudo-random number generators | Using other ideas; like procedure, flowcharts and conditionals | Not suitable if the circumstances are very complicated or if an experiment would be easier | Simulations replicate real world scenarios digitally | Experiments are held in the real world | Simulations are easier to repeat to obtain more estimations | Simulation: a way to simulate real-world environments to test safety or logistics | Simulations will not have the same result | Simulation investigates phenomenon without real world constraints of time etc. | Experiments are more accurate than simulations | Should remove other details to improve functionality of the simulation | . Simulations . A simulation is an simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena. It removes details that are unnecessary or are too difficult to simulate. The level of abstraction in a simulation depends on why we&#39;re creating it in the first place. . Why would you make a simulation? . Safer: Many safety hazards that can be encountered through experimentation can be avoided with simulations. Ex: Designing a boat to travel to an island . Less Expensive: Since real world equipment isn’t needed to make and run a simulation (only computer and programmer needed), this makes simulations an inexpensive way to test something. Ex: Boat example again . Repeatable: Once a simulation is created, it’s easy to repeat it to get different but similar results. Can Make Predictions: Something that can’t be done with experiments is making predictions. Simulations are useful for this because previous data can be used to predict what will happen in the future. Ex: Global population .

            "content": "Reflection: . In the lesson, I learned about software libraries, the use for existing code segments, APIs, and the importance of documentation for these APIs and software libraries. First off, I learned that it is very useful to use existing procedures in code, as this can make the creation of the program more efficient. Furthermore, it is important to accompany these procedures with the proper documentation, which explains what the procedure is doing and what the program is attempting to accomplish. Furthermore, I also learned more about the &quot;random&quot; module that is often used in Python. It can serve as a random number generator and a number shuffler as well, which is very cool. . Multiple Choice: . What does random (a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to b exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive . Option B is the correct answer, since the random function is used to generate a random number from a range a to b, and the random number can be the bounds of that range as well, therefore rendering it INCLUSIVE. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . Short Answer Questions: . Libraries allow us to use already tested and functional code in our own procedures. This creates a more efficient programming process. . | This procedure goes through a series of steps. First of all, the random module is imported to be used in this procedure. Then, an input is provided for the user to input everyone&#39;s names. The &quot;names&quot; variable is then defined as everyone&#39;s names split with a comma in between. Then, there is a variable defined as &quot;num_items&quot;, which measures the number of names inputted. . | Then, the random module comes into place by selecting a random number in between 0 and the number of names - 1, inclusive. Then, in order to figure out the person who will pay the bill, the numbers corresponding to the names are randomized, and the name of the person that the code lands on is printed at the end. . Coding Challenges . import random namesList = [&quot;Safin&quot;,&quot;Aarav&quot;,&quot;Boomin&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,&quot;Navan&quot;,&quot;Shaurya&quot;,&quot;Justin&quot;,&quot;Theo&quot;,&quot;James&quot;,&quot;Mihir&quot;,&quot;Aryan&quot;,&quot;Karthik&quot;,&quot;Rohan&quot;,&quot;Rohit&quot;,&quot;Zach&quot;] sample_namesList = random.sample(namesList, k=5) # here, k = number of items to select print(f&quot;you got these 5 random names: {sample_namesList}&quot;) . you got these 5 random names: [&#39;Aarav&#39;, &#39;Shaurya&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;James&#39;, &#39;Rohan&#39;] . import random player1= random.randrange(1,6) player1t2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 1 landed on a&quot;, player1, &quot;and&quot;, player1t2, &quot;adding up to:&quot;, player1+player1t2) player2 = random.randrange(1,6) player2t2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 2 landed on a&quot;, player2, &quot;and&quot;, player2t2, &quot;adding up to:&quot;, player2+player2t2) player1score = player1 + player1t2 player2score = player2 + player2t2 if player1score &gt; player2score: print(&quot;Player 1 is the winner.&quot;) elif player1score == player2score: print(&quot;It&#39;s a tie.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Player 2 is the winner.&quot;) .

            "content": "Vocab section 12 . Method/Function/Procedure - A set of code that can be run as a package, that takes in parameters and returns a return value Example: add(1, 2), which adds two numbers | Catch all terms for a set of code | . | Parameter - Input values for procedures # Vocab Section 13 | Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose | Parameter: are input values of a procedure ^ There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements (void) | Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | . Notes: . Make your names descriptive! | Make your program into smaller independent modules that can be used multiple times | Utilize update functions and recursive | . 3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Problem 1: Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed = Total Distance/Total Time . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed: . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } . Explanation: Since the first option uses the correct formula for average speed (distance over time) and the two parameters are properly utilized (distance and time), that would be the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. . Problem 2: James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion). That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . A. True B. False . Explanation: Nothing is going to be displayed, since there is no DISPLAY(__) line in the program. . Problem 3: Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers. . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) | totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252) . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252)) | laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon . Explanation: The first code snippet works, since the total footprint is outputted by adding the two flight&#39;s footprints separately and then adding them together. Then, the third code snippet also works, because it is adding the two components with each other from both flights, setting it as the entire &quot;calcFlightFootprint&quot;, and then showing it as the &quot;totalFootprint&quot;. . 3.12 Hacks Part 2 . Problem 1: . Find a. . c = 9 . b = 9 * 9 = 81 . a = b c = 81 9 = 729 . Problem #2: . Find the cost. . &#39;Temp&#39; becomes equal to 110 (100 + percent taxed, and the percent taxed is 10%.) . Then, it is divided by 100. 110/100 = 1.1 . Then, to find the final cost, the initial cost ($173) is multiplied by 1.1, which yields **$190.30**. . Problem #3: . Find the temperature in degrees Celsius. . Initial Temperature: 103 degrees Fahrenheit . 103 - 32 = 71 . 71 x (5/9) = 39.44 degrees Celsius . 3.13 Hacks . def replaceRByards(toprbyardspg, currentrbyards, totalGames): if ((toprbyardspg/totalGames) &lt; (currentrbyards/totalGames)): toprbyardspg = currentrbyards print(toprbyardspg) replaceRByards(100, 1260, 12) . PROCEDURE aPlus() { if (canMoveForward): moveForward else (canMoveRight): rotateRight moveForward if (canMoveLeft): rotateLeft moveForward } . Problem 3: Which is the correct way to define the name of a procedure? . A. PROCEDURE MYLIST B. PROCEDURE MyList C. procedure mylist . Explanation: Option B is definitely the right answer, as the procedure name is supposed to have some capital letters (not all capitals), and the word procedure should be in all caps. . PROCEDURE greenSquare { rotateLeft . moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward rotateLeft rotateLeft rotateLeft . } .",

            "content": "Notes . Iteration - Repetition of a Process . For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated . While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met . Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. . Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. . increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. . Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 . append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. . Elements [in a list] - An item in a list. . Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. . Array - Another name for a list, depends on the language . Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order | Lists can also be called arrays | Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list. | . Lists methods Mutate, meaning they actively change the list, but they don&#39;t return anything. This means that return a None-type, which you cannot manipulate . Exercise 1 . Task: Reverse a list utilizing features of lists and iteration Hint: Use two parameters with the range function . list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(&quot;original list:&quot;,list) reverse = [] for i in list: reverse = [i] + reverse print(&quot;reversed list:&quot;, reverse) #shown below is the one using the range function other=[] for i in range(1,len(list)+1): other.append(list[len(list)-i]) print(&quot;other reversed list:&quot;, other) . original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] other reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] . Exercise 2 . Task: Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array Expected Output The sorted array from 1-10 . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] array after sort [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . MC Quiz . The only question I got wrong on the quiz is the 9th question, show below: . . The correct answer to this question is &quot;FOR loops&quot;. This is because a for loop keeps running for a set number of times, which would be the most appropriate in this situation when the user is iterating over a list UNTIL the user inputs ‘quit’. I said that it would be a while loop, since I thought that it was a conditional statement if the user was inputting ‘quit’. . Reflection . Throughout these sections, I gained a better understanding of many different concepts. I learned more in depth about the main types of loops (for, while, recursive), and I was also able to learn more about the importance of iterations and lists. Learning more about certain features of lists such as the append and pop option allows me to automate certain code snippets in a more efficient manner, rather than nesting identical code to complete the same task, but in a more tedious manner. .",

Answer D is incorect because it does not change the values of j and k. However, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged. . Question 11 . Answer C is incorrect because the inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with the all elements that follow it, not the one that proceds it. . Question 32 . Answer D is incorrect because the last assignment procedure assigns a copy of myList to yourList, rather than adding one list to the other. . Question 36 . Answer A is incorect because this would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 2 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace. Developers use Rapid API to discover and connect to thousands of APIs. &quot;&quot;&quot; url = &quot;https://corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com/api&quot; headers = { &#39;x-rapidapi-key&#39;: &quot;dec069b877msh0d9d0827664078cp1a18fajsn2afac35ae063&quot;, &#39;x-rapidapi-host&#39;: &quot;corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } # Request Covid Data response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) # print(response.text) # uncomment this line to see raw data # This code looks for &quot;world data&quot; print(&quot;World Totals&quot;) world = response.json().get(&#39;world_total&#39;) # turn response to json() so we can extract &quot;world_total&quot; for key, value in world.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) print() # This code looks for USA in &quot;countries_stats&quot; print(&quot;Country Totals&quot;) countries = response.json().get(&#39;countries_stat&#39;) for country in countries: # countries is a list if country[&quot;country_name&quot;] == &quot;USA&quot;: # this filters for USA for key, value in country.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) .

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note.

JSON data is Python type: &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above? {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You are not subscribed to this API.&#39;} . Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. .

Data Abstraction . I got the Data from google I put the questions and the answers in the design tab of code.org . Managing Complexity . I made a score variable that kept track of score and goes down or up based on if they clicked the right answer. If they clicked the right answer it took them to a right answer page and the same thing for if they clicked the wrong answer. At the end I made it so that it will give the percentage of your correct anserwers when a button is clicked on . Algorithim Implemantion .

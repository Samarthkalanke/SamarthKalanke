            "content": "Reflection: . In the lesson, I learned about software libraries, the use for existing code segments, APIs, and the importance of documentation for these APIs and software libraries. First off, I learned that it is very useful to use existing procedures in code, as this can make the creation of the program more efficient. Furthermore, it is important to accompany these procedures with the proper documentation, which explains what the procedure is doing and what the program is attempting to accomplish. Furthermore, I also learned more about the &quot;random&quot; module that is often used in Python. It can serve as a random number generator and a number shuffler as well, which is very cool. . Multiple Choice: . What does random (a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to b exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive . Option B is the correct answer, since the random function is used to generate a random number from a range a to b, and the random number can be the bounds of that range as well, therefore rendering it INCLUSIVE. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . Short Answer Questions: . Libraries allow us to use already tested and functional code in our own procedures. This creates a more efficient programming process. . | This procedure goes through a series of steps. First of all, the random module is imported to be used in this procedure. Then, an input is provided for the user to input everyone&#39;s names. The &quot;names&quot; variable is then defined as everyone&#39;s names split with a comma in between. Then, there is a variable defined as &quot;num_items&quot;, which measures the number of names inputted. . | Then, the random module comes into place by selecting a random number in between 0 and the number of names - 1, inclusive. Then, in order to figure out the person who will pay the bill, the numbers corresponding to the names are randomized, and the name of the person that the code lands on is printed at the end. . Coding Challenges . import random namesList = [&quot;Safin&quot;,&quot;Aarav&quot;,&quot;Boomin&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,&quot;Navan&quot;,&quot;Shaurya&quot;,&quot;Justin&quot;,&quot;Theo&quot;,&quot;James&quot;,&quot;Mihir&quot;,&quot;Aryan&quot;,&quot;Karthik&quot;,&quot;Rohan&quot;,&quot;Rohit&quot;,&quot;Zach&quot;] sample_namesList = random.sample(namesList, k=5) # here, k = number of items to select print(f&quot;you got these 5 random names: {sample_namesList}&quot;) . you got these 5 random names: [&#39;Aarav&#39;, &#39;Shaurya&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;James&#39;, &#39;Rohan&#39;] . import random player1= random.randrange(1,6) player1t2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 1 landed on a&quot;, player1, &quot;and&quot;, player1t2, &quot;adding up to:&quot;, player1+player1t2) player2 = random.randrange(1,6) player2t2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 2 landed on a&quot;, player2, &quot;and&quot;, player2t2, &quot;adding up to:&quot;, player2+player2t2) player1score = player1 + player1t2 player2score = player2 + player2t2 if player1score &gt; player2score: print(&quot;Player 1 is the winner.&quot;) elif player1score == player2score: print(&quot;It&#39;s a tie.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Player 2 is the winner.&quot;) . Extra Credit Try . import random directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] start_move = random.choice(directions) start_point = random.randint(1,25) end_point = random.randint(1,25) print(&quot;You are starting in this direction: &quot; + start_move) print(&quot;You will start at this block number: &quot; + str(start_point)) print(&quot;Your mission if you choose to accept it is to make it to this block: &quot; + str(end_point)) print(&quot;The obstacles are in the following areas: &quot;) i = 1 while i &lt;= 6: obstacle = random.randint(1,25) print(str(obstacle)) i += 1 . You are starting in this direction: up You will start at this block number: 7 Your mission if you choose to accept it is to make it to this block: 20 The obstacles are in the following areas: 11 12 4 5 24 17 .

            "title": "Group 6 HACKS",
            "content": "3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Problem 1: Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed = Total Distance/Total Time . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed: . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } . Explanation: Since the first option uses the correct formula for average speed (distance over time) and the two parameters are properly utilized (distance and time), that would be the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. . Problem 2: James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion). That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . A. True B. False . Explanation: Nothing is going to be displayed, since there is no DISPLAY(__) line in the program. . Problem 3: Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers. . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) | totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252) . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252)) | laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon . Explanation: The first code snippet works, since the total footprint is outputted by adding the two flight&#39;s footprints separately and then adding them together. Then, the third code snippet also works, because it is adding the two components with each other from both flights, setting it as the entire &quot;calcFlightFootprint&quot;, and then showing it as the &quot;totalFootprint&quot;. . 3.12 Hacks Part 2 . Problem 1: . Find a. . c = 9 . b = 9 * 9 = 81 . a = b c = 81 9 = 729 . Problem #2: . Find the cost. . &#39;Temp&#39; becomes equal to 110 (100 + percent taxed, and the percent taxed is 10%.) . Then, it is divided by 100. 110/100 = 1.1 . Then, to find the final cost, the initial cost ($173) is multiplied by 1.1, which yields **$190.30**. . Problem #3: . Find the temperature in degrees Celsius. . Initial Temperature: 103 degrees Fahrenheit . 103 - 32 = 71 . 71 x (5/9) = 39.44 degrees Celsius . 3.13 Hacks . def replaceRByards(toprbyardspg, currentrbyards, totalGames): if ((toprbyardspg/totalGames) &lt; (currentrbyards/totalGames)): toprbyardspg = currentrbyards print(toprbyardspg) replaceRByards(100, 1260, 12) . PROCEDURE aPlus() { if (canMoveForward): moveForward else (canMoveRight): rotateRight moveForward if (canMoveLeft): rotateLeft moveForward } . Problem 3: Which is the correct way to define the name of a procedure? . A. PROCEDURE MYLIST B. PROCEDURE MyList C. procedure mylist . Explanation: Option B is definitely the right answer, as the procedure name is supposed to have some capital letters (not all capitals), and the word procedure should be in all caps. . PROCEDURE greenSquare { rotateLeft . moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward rotateLeft rotateLeft rotateLeft . } .",

            "content": "Notes . Iteration - Repetition of a Process . For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated . While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met . Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. . Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. . increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. . Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 . append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. . Elements [in a list] - An item in a list. . Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. . Array - Another name for a list, depends on the language . Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order | Lists can also be called arrays | Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list. | . Lists methods Mutate, meaning they actively change the list, but they don&#39;t return anything. This means that return a None-type, which you cannot manipulate . Exercise 1 . Task: Reverse a list utilizing features of lists and iteration Hint: Use two parameters with the range function . list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(&quot;original list:&quot;,list) reverse = [] for i in list: reverse = [i] + reverse print(&quot;reversed list:&quot;, reverse) #shown below is the one using the range function other=[] for i in range(1,len(list)+1): other.append(list[len(list)-i]) print(&quot;other reversed list:&quot;, other) . original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] other reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] . Exercise 2 . Task: Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array Expected Output The sorted array from 1-10 . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] array after sort [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . MC Quiz . The only question I got wrong on the quiz is the 9th question, show below: . . The correct answer to this question is &quot;FOR loops&quot;. This is because a for loop keeps running for a set number of times, which would be the most appropriate in this situation when the user is iterating over a list UNTIL the user inputs ‘quit’. I said that it would be a while loop, since I thought that it was a conditional statement if the user was inputting ‘quit’. . Reflection . Throughout these sections, I gained a better understanding of many different concepts. I learned more in depth about the main types of loops (for, while, recursive), and I was also able to learn more about the importance of iterations and lists. Learning more about certain features of lists such as the append and pop option allows me to automate certain code snippets in a more efficient manner, rather than nesting identical code to complete the same task, but in a more tedious manner. .",

Answer D is incorect because it does not change the values of j and k. However, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged. . Question 11 . Answer C is incorrect because the inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with the all elements that follow it, not the one that proceds it. . Question 32 . Answer D is incorrect because the last assignment procedure assigns a copy of myList to yourList, rather than adding one list to the other. . Question 36 . Answer A is incorect because this would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 2 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]. .",

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. .

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",
